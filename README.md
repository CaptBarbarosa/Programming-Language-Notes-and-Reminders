# General C Learning Repository

Welcome to my General C Learning Repository! 🚀

This repository serves as my personal space for storing and documenting the things I didn't learn in school or the things I needed to remember related to the C programming language. It's not a project but rather a collection of notes, snippets, and experiments as I continue to explore and expand my knowledge in C.

## What's Inside?

- **Notes:** Detailed explanations, concepts, and insights that go beyond the basics.
- **Snippets:** Handy code snippets, examples, and solutions to common C programming challenges.
- **Experiments:** Small projects and experiments to apply and test my understanding.

## Why This Repository?

While my formal education covered the fundamentals, this repository is dedicated to the additional knowledge and insights I've gained through self-directed learning. It's a dynamic space that evolves as I continue to explore new aspects of C.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute if you find anything interesting or have suggestions for improvement. Happy coding! 👨‍💻
